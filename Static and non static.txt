Select- this is a class name used for droupdowns.
WebElement - this is a class used to store the webelements by creating an object.

**********************************************************************************************************

Methods are of two types- static and non static methods. 

-Accessing methods coming from same class:
 -----------------------------------------

1.(Static method - Static method)
  -To access a static method into another static method coming from same class, we no need
   to create any object, we can access directly.

2.(Static method - Non static method):
   -To access a static method into a non static method coming from same class, we no need
   to create any object, we can access directly.

3.(Non static method - Static method):
    -To access a non static method into a static method coming from same class, we need
     to create an object, by using the object we can access the method.

4.(Non static method - Non static method):
    -To access a non static method into another non static method coming from same class, we no need
   to create any object, we can access directly.

-Accessing methods coming from different class:
 ----------------------------------------------

1. To access a static method into another static method, coming from different class, we no need to 
   create an object, but we need specify class name.


2. To access a static method into a non static method, coming from different class, we no need to 
   create an object, but we need specify class name.

3. To access a non static method into a static method coming from differernt class we need to creare 
   an object for sure.

4. To access a non static method into a non static method coming from a different class we need to create 
   an object for sure.

Method OverRiding:
-having a method in the child class and you are having a method in parent class with same method name
 but with different implementations.

Exception:
-Exception is nothing but the deviation from the expected behaviour or the error message occured 
 during the flow.

-Two tyoes of exceptions:
1.Java Exceptions
2.Selenium Exceptions.

To handle Java exceptions we can use
-Add throws declation
-Surround with try/catch

To handle selenium exceptions:
-Surround with try/catch.

When exception occurs at the time of compilation, it is called compile exception. occurs at the time of saving.

When exection occuers at the time of runtime it is called runtime exception.

Java exception can be in both CT and RT, whereas selenium exception can be only in RT.
